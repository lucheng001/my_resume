                        and then try to be a member of government, this not my life. You Only Live Once! why not make your life be colorful?</p>

                            Up to now(2016-11-15) I have been used Linux as my PC system for 2 years, in the past I had tried Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuse, FreeBSD and now ArchLinux, in it ArchLinux is a prefect OS for PC, and FreeBSD is a excellent OS for service.<br>

                            In the past career of my college I will try to use Docker to deploy some service and also as time allowed maybe I will try to perfect my front-end skills or learn Node.js or Golang.
